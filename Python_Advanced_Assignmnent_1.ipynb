What is the purpose of Python's OOP?**\n","\n","Ans: Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that provides a means of structuring programs so that properties and behaviors are bundled into individual objects\n","\n","In Python, object-oriented Programming (OOPs) uses objects and classes in programming.\n","\n","It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming.\n","\n","The main concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data.\n","\n","It comes up with the following advantages:\n","\n","It helps to divide our over all program into different small segments and thus making it solving easy with the use of objects\n","\n","Helps in easy maintenance and modification of existing program\n","\n","Multiple instances of an object can be made."],"metadata":{"id":"kS-FNVlkg_7k"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Q2.

What is the process for creating a class instance?**\n","\n","Ans: To create a class instance, we need to call the class by its name and pass the arguments to the class, which its init method accepts.\n","\n","Example: my_name = my_class(\"Shubham\",\"kumar\") Here my_name is an instance of class my_class with attributes \"Shubham\" and \"kumar\"."],"metadata":{"id":"k078RwF9hs2u"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Q7.
